                        I’m Mario A. Sánchez, a sound artist and programmer currently based in Miami, 
                        specialising primarily in audio, music, and all things having to do with sound.

                        Growing up in Puerto Rico, most of my initial exposure to music came from practicing 
                        the Classical Guitar up until my 17 years of age, where I moved to London and graduated 
                        with a degree in Music Computing from Goldsmiths, University of London in 2020. Here my exposure to the 
                        possibilities contained within music and electronics was increased tenfold, having participated on some 
                        research with Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink and volunteered at the Audio Developer’s Convention in 2019 among 
                        some other projects.

                        Having graduated, I am now residing in Miami, Florida as of 2021. If you want to get in contact, just 
                        go ahead and send me an email.
